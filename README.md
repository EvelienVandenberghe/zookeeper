Zookeeper with Java

Before continuing uploading the projects from the Hyperskill Java Developer track, I will do the Intro projects in between. This application helps zookeepers monitor and manage their animal habitats efficiently.

Features
This tool simulates security cameras placed throughout different animal habitats at a zoo. Zookeepers can enter habitat numbers to "switch on" cameras and view ASCII art representations of animals along with their current status.This zoo management tool provides zookeepers with essential animal monitoring capabilities:

Visual Animal Display: ASCII art representations of different animals for quick visual identification.
Habitat Lookup System: Enter any habitat number to instantly see which animals are housed there.
Continuous Operation: Menu-driven interface that stays active for multiple queries without restarting.
Simple Navigation: Easy-to-use text commands for efficient zoo management workflows.

Available Habitats

Habitat 0: Camel - Watch our camel sunbathing
Habitat 1: Lion - Listen to the mighty roar
Habitat 2: Deer - Check if Bambi needs feeding
Habitat 3: Goose - Observe the goose's watchful behavior
